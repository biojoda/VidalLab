üçÖ Downloadable Organ-level GRNs for Solanum lycopersicum
Welcome to the Tomato Organ-level Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) resource!
This folder provides ready-to-use, community-accessible GRNs for Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), generated from high-quality transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets.

üìÇ Available Files
You‚Äôll find one GRN file per organ:

Seed_GRN.txt

Root_GRN.txt

Leaf_GRN.txt

Flower_GRN.txt

Fruit_GRN.txt

Each file is a tab-separated .txt file with the following structure:

Column	Description
1. TF	Transcription Factor
2. Target	Target Gene
3. Evidence	Supporting regulatory evidence: may include one or more of the following ‚Üí GENIE3, Coex, OCS, Promo
‚ö†Ô∏è All edges originate from GENIE3 predictions and are optionally supported by co-expression (Coex), open chromatin signals (OCS), and/or promoter motif presence (Promo).

üß™ How to Use
These files can be easily integrated into your own analyses or visualized using popular tools such as:

Cytoscape ‚Äì for interactive network exploration

R / Python ‚Äì for programmatic filtering, analysis, or graph-based modeling

Excel / LibreOffice ‚Äì for simple inspection or filtering
