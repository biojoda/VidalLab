🍅 Welcome to the Tomato GRNs Pipelines Repository.

This repository contains the full set of scripts and resources used to generate and analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), as described in our publication.

Here, you will find:

🧬 Pipelines for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, and DAP-seq data processing

🔄 The complete GENIE3-based GRN inference pipeline

🌐 The final GRNs generated from our analyses

All pipelines are organized for clarity and reproducibility, and can be adapted to other datasets with minor modifications.

Feel free to explore, reuse, or contribute. If you use this work, please cite the corresponding article.
