## About Us

Welcome to Plantomics Lab, a cutting-edge research group at the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Universidad Mayor. We are proud members of the Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of plant adaptation and responses to the environment. Our work revolves around harnessing genomics and systems biology approaches to gain deeper insights into the intricate world of plants.

### Mission Statement

At PlantomicsLab, our mission is to decode the complex gene networks that govern plant development and responses to environmental stimuli. Employing an integrative approach, we merge the analysis of omics data, the modeling of gene networks, and experimental validation using molecular biology tools. Our primary focus includes the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and other plants of agronomic interest, such as Solanum lycopersicum.
